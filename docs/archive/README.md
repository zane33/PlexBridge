This directory contains historical documentation and analysis reports generated during the development and debugging process of PlexBridge. These files have been archived to maintain a clean project structure while preserving development history.

## Archive Contents

### Streaming Analysis Reports

- **`STREAMING_FUNCTIONALITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`** - Comprehensive analysis of stream preview functionality
- **`STREAMING_FIXES_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`** - Verification testing of streaming fixes  
- **`STREAMING_M3U_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`** - M3U import optimization analysis

### Critical Issue Analysis

- **`CRITICAL_VIDEO_PLAYER_DIAGNOSIS_REPORT.md`** - Root cause analysis of video player issues
- **`CRITICAL_VIDEO_PLAYER_FIXES_REPORT.md`** - Implementation details of video player fixes

### Implementation Documentation

- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Technical implementation summary and architecture details

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Video Player Audio-Only Problem
**Root Cause**: HLS streams with relative URLs not working in browsers
**Solution**: Always enable transcoding (`?transcode=true`) for browser previews
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. VLC Compatibility Issues  
**Root Cause**: VLC expecting direct video streams, not HLS playlists
**Solution**: Use transcoding parameter for external players
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 3. Video.js Flash Tech Errors
**Root Cause**: Flash technology referenced in Video.js configuration
**Solution**: Remove Flash from `techOrder` array, use HTML5 only
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 4. M3U Import Pagination
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded 50-channel limit in import interface
**Solution**: Remove limit, implement proper pagination controls
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Archive Organization

### Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Development History**: Preserve detailed analysis and debugging process
2. **Clean Codebase**: Remove temporary reports from active project directory
3. **Reference Material**: Maintain technical details for future reference
4. **Documentation Quality**: Keep only current, relevant documentation in main docs

### Current Active Documentation

The main `/docs/` directory contains:
- **`Plex-Live-TV-Integration.md`** - Comprehensive Plex integration guide
- **`README.md`** - Main project documentation (if present)

### Current Active Tests

The main `/tests/` directory contains:
- **Core functionality tests** - Active test suites for ongoing development
- **`README.md`** - Current testing guide and procedures
- **`screenshots/`** - Test screenshots for visual verification
- **`archive/`** - Historical test files from debugging sessions

## Historical Context

These archived documents represent the comprehensive analysis and fixing process for PlexBridge's streaming functionality, conducted in August 2025. The analysis identified and resolved critical issues with:

- Stream format compatibility across different clients (browsers, Plex, VLC)
- Video player configuration and codec support
- M3U playlist import and pagination
- HDHomeRun protocol emulation for Plex Live TV

## Technical Insights Preserved

### Stream Format Strategy
- **Browsers**: Transcoded MP4 for universal compatibility
- **Plex**: MPEG-TS format for HDHomeRun emulation
- **External Players**: HLS or transcoded based on client capabilities

### Video Player Architecture
- Removed Flash technology dependencies
- Implemented client-aware format serving
- Added automatic transcoding for browser compatibility

### Plex Integration Details
- Complete SSDP/UPnP discovery protocol implementation
- Proper HDHomeRun API endpoint emulation
- XMLTV EPG integration with automatic refresh
