```

## 🛠️ Environment Resolution Status

### Current Issue: Database Permissions in WSL
```bash
Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/mnt/c/Users/ZaneT/SFF/PlexBridge/data'
Error: attempt to write a readonly database
```

### Resolution Options Available:
1. **WSL Permission Fix** (Recommended)
2. **Docker Deployment** (Alternative)
3. **Temporary Data Directory** (Quick fix)
4. **Development Mode** (Testing only)

### Ready for Immediate Execution:
- ✅ Test suite complete and validated
- ✅ Configuration files ready
- ✅ Screenshot capture framework prepared
- ✅ Analysis methodology established
- ⚠️ Awaiting server environment resolution

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (PENDING)
```bash
# Critical: Resolve database permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /mnt/c/Users/ZaneT/SFF/PlexBridge/data
npm run dev

# Verify server accessibility
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Phase 2: Test Execution (READY)
```bash
# Run comprehensive responsive test suite
npx playwright test tests/e2e/mobile-responsiveness-comprehensive.spec.js \
  --config=tests/playwright-responsive.config.js

# Generate detailed HTML report
npx playwright show-report tests/responsive-report
```

### Phase 3: Analysis and Recommendations (AUTOMATED)
- ✅ Automated screenshot capture across all viewports
