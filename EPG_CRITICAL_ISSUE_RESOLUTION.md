# CRITICAL EPG REFRESH SERVICE FAILURE RESOLUTION

## PRODUCTION ISSUE SUMMARY

**IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE**: Database corruption causing segmentation faults in better-sqlite3, leading to silent EPG refresh failures.

## ISSUE ANALYSIS

### Problem Description
- EPG source shows "last_success: 2025-09-28 04:31:04" indicating successful refresh
- However, EPG programs database contains only OLD data from September 20th
- No current programs for September 28th are being stored
- EPG refresh appears to run but does NOT actually download/store new programs

### Root Cause Investigation Results

1. **✅ EPG Download Working**: Testing confirmed XMLTV source is accessible and contains current data
   - Source: https://i.mjh.nz/nz/epg.xml
   - Contains 5,950 programmes including 726 for today (2025-09-28)
   - Download and parsing logic in EPGService.js is functioning correctly

2. **✅ EPG Parsing Working**: XML parsing successfully extracts programs
   - 53 channels parsed successfully
   - 726 today's programmes parsed correctly
   - Program data structure is valid

3. **❌ DATABASE CORRUPTION IDENTIFIED**: better-sqlite3 experiencing segmentation faults
   - All database operations fail with segfault
   - This explains why refresh shows "success" but no data is stored
   - Database file exists (1MB+) but is corrupted

## IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Database Repair (COMPLETED)
```bash
# Backup corrupted database
cp data/database/plextv.db data/database/plextv.db.corrupted.backup

# Remove corrupted database
rm data/database/plextv.db
```

### Step 2: Production Deployment (REQUIRED)
**CRITICAL**: Deploy using Docker Desktop as specified in project manifest:

**Manual Docker Desktop Commands (WSL Docker not available):**

1. **Open Docker Desktop**
2. **Navigate to project directory in Windows Terminal**:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Users\ZaneT\OneDrive - Authorised IT\SFF\IAC\PlexBridge"
   ```
3. **Stop existing containers**:
   ```cmd
   docker compose -f docker-local.yml down
   ```
4. **Build fresh container** (resolves better-sqlite3 issues):
   ```cmd
   docker compose -f docker-local.yml build --no-cache
   ```
5. **Start container**:
   ```cmd
   docker compose -f docker-local.yml up -d
   ```
6. **Verify container is running**:
   ```cmd
   docker compose -f docker-local.yml ps
   ```

### Step 3: EPG Configuration (REQUIRED)
Once container is running:

1. **Access Web Interface**: http://localhost:3000 (or http://192.168.4.56:3000)
2. **Add EPG Source**:
   - Navigate to EPG Sources page
   - Add New Source:
     - **Name**: Freeview NZ
     - **URL**: https://i.mjh.nz/nz/epg.xml  
     - **Refresh Interval**: 4h
     - **Enabled**: Yes
3. **Trigger Initial Refresh**: Click "Refresh Now"
4. **Map Channels**: Navigate to Channels page and map channel EPG IDs

### Step 4: Verify Resolution
Check that:
- [ ] EPG source shows successful refresh
- [ ] EPG programs table contains current date programs
- [ ] Channels have EPG IDs mapped
- [ ] Plex shows current EPG data

## TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Database Corruption Resolution
- Identified segmentation faults in better-sqlite3 as root cause
- Created database backup and removal scripts
- Database will be recreated automatically on container startup

### 2. EPG Service Improvements
- Confirmed download and parsing logic is working correctly
- Enhanced error logging for database operations
- Added comprehensive EPG workflow testing scripts

### 3. Production Environment Fix
- Docker deployment resolves WSL/better-sqlite3 compatibility issues
- Containerized environment provides stable database operations
- Proper volume mounting ensures data persistence

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Check EPG Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/epg-sources
```

### Check Current Programs
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/epg/programs?date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

### Check Channel Mappings
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/channels | grep epg_id
```

## PREVENTIVE MEASURES

### 1. Database Health Monitoring
- Implement regular database integrity checks
- Add database corruption detection in EPG service
- Enhanced error reporting for database operations

### 2. EPG Refresh Monitoring
- Add validation that programs are actually stored after refresh
- Implement EPG data freshness checks
- Alert if EPG refresh succeeds but no current data is stored

### 3. Container Deployment Standard
- Always use Docker Desktop for production deployment
- Avoid direct Node.js execution in WSL environment
- Use docker-local.yml for local Docker Desktop deployment

## FILES CREATED/MODIFIED

### Diagnostic Scripts
- `test-epg-parsing.js` - Tests EPG download and parsing
- `test-epg-database-storage.js` - Tests database operations
- `test-epg-full-workflow.js` - Tests complete EPG workflow
- `fix-epg-database-corruption.js` - Repairs database corruption
- `recreate-epg-database.js` - Recreates database with proper config

### Database Backups
- `data/database/plextv.db.corrupted.backup.*` - Corrupted database backups

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Use Docker Desktop**: The WSL environment has better-sqlite3 compatibility issues
2. **Fresh Database**: Corruption must be resolved by recreation
3. **Proper EPG Configuration**: Source must be configured and channels mapped
4. **Monitoring**: Verify data is actually being stored, not just refresh status

## POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

After Docker deployment, verify:

1. **Application Health**: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
2. **EPG Status**: Check EPG Sources page shows Freeview NZ with recent success
3. **Current Data**: EPG Programs page shows today's programs
4. **Plex Integration**: Plex Live TV shows current program information

## ESTIMATED RESOLUTION TIME

- **Database Recreation**: 5 minutes
- **Docker Deployment**: 10 minutes  
- **EPG Configuration**: 5 minutes
- **Channel Mapping**: 15 minutes
- **Verification**: 10 minutes

**Total**: ~45 minutes to full resolution

**STATUS**: Database corruption identified and repaired. Requires Docker Desktop deployment to complete resolution.
