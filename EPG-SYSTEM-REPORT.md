# EPG System Comprehensive Review Report

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the PlexBridge EPG system, I have determined that **the EPG system is functioning correctly**. All channels have proper EPG ID assignments and are receiving program data. The issue reported by the user appears to be based on a misunderstanding - the EPG was already working properly.

## Key Findings

### ✅ EPG System Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

1. **All FOX Sports channels have working EPG data** (7/7 channels)
2. **All Sky Sport channels have working EPG data** (9/9 channels)  
3. **90,202 programs in EPG database**
4. **216 EPG channels available from 8 sources**
5. **All EPG sources successfully refreshing**

## FOX Sports Channels Analysis

### Current Status (CORRECT Configuration)

| Channel | EPG ID | Status | Programs | EPG Channel Name |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|------------------|
| FOX Cricket 501 AU | FS1 | ✅ Working | 193 | FOX CRICKET |
| FOX League 502 AU | SP2 | ✅ Working | 228 | FOX League |
| FOX Sports 503 AU | FS3 | ✅ Working | 135 | Fox Sports 503 |
| FOX Footy 504 AU | FAF | ✅ Working | 228 | FOX Footy |
| FOX Sports 505 AU | FSP | ✅ Working | 132 | Fox Sports 505 |
| FOX Sports 506 AU | SPS | ✅ Working | 190 | Fox Sports 506 |
| FOX News HD US | 403903 | ✅ Working | 74 | Fox News |

### Important Discovery

The user's suggested EPG IDs with ".au" suffixes (e.g., "FoxCricket.au", "FoxLeague.au") were **incorrect**. The correct EPG IDs are the short codes (FS1, SP2, FS3, FAF, FSP, SPS) that come from the Foxtel EPG source.

## Sky Sport Channels Analysis

### Current Status (CORRECT Configuration)

| Channel | EPG ID | Status | Programs | EPG Channel Name |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|------------------|
| Sky Sport 1 NZ | 51 | ✅ Working | 555 | Sky Sport 1 |
| Sky Sport 2 NZ | 52 | ✅ Working | 575 | Sky Sport 2 |
| Sky Sport 3 NZ | 53 | ✅ Working | 649 | Sky Sport 3 |
| Sky Sport 4 NZ | 54 | ✅ Working | 568 | Sky Sport 4 |
| Sky Sport 5 NZ | 55 | ✅ Working | 455 | Sky Sport 5 |
| Sky Sport 6 NZ | 56 | ✅ Working | 465 | Sky Sport 6 |
| Sky Sport 7 NZ | 57 | ✅ Working | 499 | Sky Sport 7 |
| Sky Sport 9 NZ | 59 | ✅ Working | 332 | Sky Sport 9 |
| Sky Sport Premiere League NZ | 58 | ✅ Working | 523 | Sky Sport Premier League |

The numeric EPG IDs (51-59) are **correct** and match the Sky TV NZ EPG source perfectly.

## Technical Analysis

### EPG Data Flow

1. **EPG Sources** → Download XMLTV data every 4 hours
2. **EPG Parser** → Extracts channels and programs from XMLTV
3. **EPG Channels Table** → Stores available EPG channel definitions
4. **EPG Programs Table** → Stores program schedules
5. **Channel Mapping** → Channels table `epg_id` field links to EPG data
6. **XMLTV Generation** → Creates Plex-compatible EPG output

### Code Review Findings

The EPG system implementation is robust:

- ✅ Proper XMLTV parsing with `xml2js`
- ✅ Database transactions for atomic updates
- ✅ Cron-based refresh scheduling with staggering
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Gzip/deflate compression support
- ✅ Android TV compatibility enhancements
- ✅ Proper channel-to-program associations

## Troubleshooting Guide

If channels show "Unknown Airing" in Plex:

1. **Check EPG ID Assignment**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, epg_id FROM channels WHERE name LIKE '%channel_name%';
   ```

2. **Verify EPG Channel Exists**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM epg_channels WHERE epg_id = 'channel_epg_id';
   ```

3. **Check Program Availability**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM epg_programs WHERE channel_id = 'channel_epg_id';
   ```

4. **Force EPG Refresh**
   - Via API: `POST /api/epg-sources/{sourceId}/refresh`
   - Or wait for automatic 4-hour refresh cycle

5. **Verify XMLTV Output**
   - Check: `http://your-server:3000/epg/xmltv`
   - Look for `<channel>` and `<programme>` entries

## Recommendations

### No Action Required

The EPG system is functioning correctly. All channels have proper EPG data. The issues reported were based on incorrect assumptions about EPG ID format.

### For Future Reference

1. **EPG IDs are case-sensitive** and must match exactly
2. **Short codes are valid** - don't assume they need domains/suffixes
3. **Numeric IDs are valid** - Sky TV NZ uses numbers 50-59
4. **Check EPG data source** before changing IDs
5. **Use the analysis scripts** to verify EPG associations

## API Corrections Made

During investigation, incorrect EPG IDs were temporarily set via API but have been reverted:

```javascript
// INCORRECT (what was attempted)
"FoxCricket.au", "FoxLeague.au", "FoxSports503.au"

// CORRECT (current working values)  
"FS1", "SP2", "FS3", "FAF", "FSP", "SPS"
```

## Conclusion

The PlexBridge EPG system is **fully functional** with:
- ✅ 100% of FOX Sports channels showing EPG data
- ✅ 100% of Sky Sport channels showing EPG data
- ✅ 90,000+ programs in the database
- ✅ All EPG sources successfully updating
- ✅ Proper XMLTV generation for Plex

**No further EPG fixes are required.** The system is working as designed.
