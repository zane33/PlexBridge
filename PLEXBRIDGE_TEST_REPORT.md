## Current Deployment Configuration

### Container Status
```
CONTAINER ID: 66e0ca57cd6a
IMAGE: plexbridge-plextv  
STATUS: Up 17 minutes (healthy)
PORTS: 8080:8080/tcp, 1900:1900/udp
```

### Running Processes
```
PID 1: /sbin/tini (init)
PID 7: supervisord (process manager)
PID 8: redis-server 127.0.0.1:6379
PID 257: node /app/server/production-start-minimal.js
```

### Server Configuration
- **Mode:** Minimal production deployment
- **Purpose:** Stability and reliability over full feature set
- **Serves:** Static React frontend + health endpoint
- **Database:** SQLite with Redis caching
- **Logging:** Supervisord managed

## Browser Console Analysis

### Expected Behavior in Minimal Mode
The frontend React application attempts to connect to API endpoints that are not available in minimal mode:

**Missing Endpoints (Expected in Minimal Mode):**
- `/api/metrics` - System metrics endpoint
- `/streams/active` - Active streams monitoring  
- `/api/server/info` - Server information
- `/socket.io/` - WebSocket for real-time updates

**These are expected 404s** as the application is running in minimal deployment mode for stability.

## Screenshots Captured

1. **Homepage** (`01-homepage.png`) - Main dashboard view
2. **Main Interface** (`02-main-interface.png`) - Full application interface
3. **Navigation** (`03-route-home.png`) - After navigation interaction
4. **Desktop View** (`04-responsive-desktop.png`) - Full desktop layout
5. **Tablet View** (`04-responsive-tablet.png`) - Tablet responsive design

## Recommendations

### 1. For Full API Testing
To test the complete API functionality, consider:
- Switching to full production mode (`server/index.js`)
- Using development mode (`npm run dev`)
- Enabling all service components

### 2. For Production Deployment
Current minimal mode is excellent for:
- ✅ Stable production deployments
- ✅ Reduced attack surface
- ✅ Lower resource usage
- ✅ High reliability

### 3. For Development
For full feature development, use:
- `npm run dev` for development server
- Full API endpoint testing
- WebSocket functionality testing
